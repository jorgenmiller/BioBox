# BioBox

JÃ¸rgen Miller and Charlie Giglio

BioBox began as a project for the 2020 Frederick County Virtual Science & Engineering Fair.

This repository holds past files for the physical BioBox prototype. It used an Arduino to measure sensor outputs and sent them to a Raspberry Pi to be written to a file. This repository holds the Arduino code.
